					Effective data analysis (statistical or otherwise) requires effective data manipulation and summarization. Without
					the right tools, manipulating your data to be in the correct format for a particular statistical test can be the 
					biggest time suck in your analysis.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Fortunately, some appropriate tools exist. Two packages written by <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, 
					<rcode>reshape</rcode> and <rcode>plyr</rcode>,
					have become central components to all of my data analyses.
				</p>
				
				<h2><a name = "structuring_data"></a>Structuring Data</h2>
					<p>
						To effectively use the <rcode>reshape</rcode> package, it's probably useful to think about data structure the same way it does.
					</p>
					<h3><a name = "id_and_measure_variables"></a>ID and Measure Variables</h3>
						<p>
							For any given data set there will be two kinds of variables.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>ID Variables:</b> These variables are identifiers or features of each unique observation. Essentially anything
							you are testing to see if it has an effect on outcomes will be an ID variable.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Measure Variables:</b> These variables record your measurement of each unique observation. 
						</p>
						<p>What counts as an ID Variable or a Measure Variable will depend upon the study. For instance, in most studies sex
						of the subject will usually be an ID Variable, and something about the subject's response will be a Measure Variable. However,
						if you're doing a study as to whether men or women are more likely to show up to your experiment, sex of subject would be a 
						Measurement Variable.</p>
					<h3><a name = "organization"></a>Organization</h3>
						<p>
							There are two ways to organize your ID and Measure variables which I'll focus on here. I'll call them the
							ideal way, and the flexible way. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The ideal way to organize your table is with a row for every unique combination of ID variables. This will produce 
							a column for every ID variable, and then a column for every kind of measurement. If you were doing a study keeping track
							of how many apples and oranges subjects bought, and then how many of those apples and oranges subjects ate, the ideal data
							format would look like Table 1.
						</p>

						Frequently, you will see data published looking like Table 2. This is a fine summary table format for publication in a paper, 
						but it does not have the proper structure for rapid and easy statistical analysis, or graphical representation. Notice that the levels
						of the Fruit ID variable are represented in the columns, rather than in the rows.

						<caption><b>Table 2<br>Summary Table</b></caption>
					</table>
					</center>
					
					<p>
						If you already have data stored in only this summary format, or some other summary format, don't worry. By using the 
						<rcode>reshape::melt()</rcode> function, we can get from the summary format 
						to the ideal format. I would encourage you not to store data in summary formats anymore, however.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The ideal data format is probably the one you will use the most for statistical analysis, graphical representation, and data storage.
						However, we're going to focus a lot on what I'm calling the flexible format. For the most part, we'll be reformatting data from the
						ideal format to the flexible format, and then manipulating it using functions from the <rcode>reshape</rcode>
						(<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape/index.html">Cran</a>, 
						<a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/">website</a>) package.
					</p>
					<p>
						The flexible data format has a row for every unique combination of ID variable <i>and measurement type</i>, with a column for the
						value of the measurement. For the apples and oranges data, it would look this way.

						At this point, you might be incredulous. We are, in fact, mixing different measurement types in the Value column. If you're not

						As you can see, we are mixing values in hertz with values in miliseconds in a single column. This <i>should</i> offend your
						data sensibilities. However, with clever use of the <rcode>reshape::cast()</rcode> function, the flexible format is not only one 
						line of code away from the ideal format, but from the summary format, and all other manners of aggregation.

				<h2><a name = "reshape_package"></a> <rcode>reshape</rcode> Package</h2>
					<p>
						The webpage for the <rcode>reshape</rcode> package is located here: <a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/">http://had.co.nz/reshape/</a>. The
						<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v21/i12">suggested documentation</a> on that page is pretty good.
					</p>
					
				<h3><a name = "gender_gap"></a>Gender Gap</h3>
				<p>
					This next data set also comes from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/gender-educationsgendergap">a post</a> 
					to the Guardian Data blog about gender inequality. You can find the data here: 
					<a href="data/gender_equality.txt">http://jofrhwld.github.com/talks/PennState2011/r/data/gender_equality.txt</a>
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>gender <- read.delim("http://jofrhwld.github.com/talks/PennState2011/r/data/gender_equality.txt")</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					The next step is to "melt" the data with the <rcode>reshape::melt()</rcode> function. The arguments that <rcode>melt()</rcode> takes 
					are:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><rcode>data</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The data frame containing the data.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>id.vars</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The columns which define the id variables</dd>
					<dt><rcode>measure.vars</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The columns which define measure variables. By default, it assumes all non-id variables are measure variables</dd>
					<dt><rcode>variable_name</rcode></dt>
						<dd>What you want to call the new variable column. The default is "variable", which is pretty fine.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					This data set has two ID variables: Country and Gender. Unfortunately, Gender has been spread across the columns with the measure variables.
					So, in <rcode>melt()</rcode> we'll tell it that Country is the only ID variable.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						 ## Melt the data!<br>
						 gender.m <- melt(gender, id = 1, na.rm = T)<br>
						 ## Equivalently<br>
						 #gender.m <- melt(gender, id = "Counry", na.rm = T)<br>
						 head(gender.m)<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
              Country       variable value
1         Afghanistan LifeExp_Female  43.2
2             Albania LifeExp_Female  79.7
3             Algeria LifeExp_Female  73.3
4             Andorra LifeExp_Female  84.2
5              Angola LifeExp_Female  43.7
6 Antigua and Barbuda LifeExp_Female  74.5
				</pre>
				<p>
					Now we need to split the column called <rcode>variable</rcode> into two: <rcode>Measure</rcode> and <rcode>Gender</rcode>.
					Fortunately, there is a function just for this task in <rcode>reshape</rcode> called <rcode>colsplit()</rcode>. It takes the 
					following arguments.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><rcode>x</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The column (or vector) to be split.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>split</rcode></dt>
						<dd>A definition of what character to split the vector by (regex).</dd>
					<dt><rcode>names</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The names of the new columns to be created</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>
					<rcode>colsplit()</rcode> just returns a data frame of the split column. 
				</p>				
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
					new.cols <- colsplit(gender.m$variable, split = "_", names = c("Measure","Gender"))<br><br>
					head(new.cols)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					We need to <rcode>cbind()</rcode> these new columns onto the old data frame. Of course, this can all be condensed into
					one (gnarly) line of code.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						gender.m <- cbind(gender.m, new.cols)<br>
						head(gender.m)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					Now that we have the data in this format, we can recast the data into almost any shape, including various aggregations.
					The function to recast data is called <rcode>reshape::cast()</rcode>. It takes the following arguments:
				</p>
					<dl>
					<dt><rcode>data</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The data frame containing molten data.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>formula</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The casting formula. Variables to the left of the <rcode>~</rcode> define rows, and variables 
						to the right define columns. A pipe (<rcode>|</rcode>) following the formula defines subsets.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>value</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The column to treat as the value. By default, it assumes that a column named "<rcode>value</rcode>"
						is the value column</dd>
					<dt><rcode>fun.aggregate</rcode></dt>
						<dd>aggregation function</dd>
					<dt><rcode>margins</rcode></dt>
						<dd>Which margins to calculate grand summaries for</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>
					We know that there is at most one observation for each measure for each country for each gender. If we wanted to recast
					the data so that it's got a column for each gender, we can do so this way. 
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(gender.m, Country + Measure ~ Gender)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					Since there was only one value per cell, <rcode>cast()</rcode> filled that value into the cell. However, if more than
					one value can fit into a cell, <rcode>cast()</rcode> has to aggregate the data some how. For example:
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(gender.m, Measure ~ Gender)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
  Aggregation requires fun.aggregate: length used as default
     Measure Female Male
  1      Edu    178  178
  2   Income    174  174
  3  LifeExp    194  194
  4 Literacy    171  171
				</pre>
				
				<p>
					By crossing <rcode>Measure</rcode> and <rcode>Gender</rcode>, there are between 194 and 171 observations per cell. By default, 
					<rcode>cast()</rcode> applies, <rcode>length()</rcode> to these observations, which tells you how many observations there were.
					You can also apply other summary functions, for example
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(gender.m, Measure ~ Gender, fun = median)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
     Measure  Female    Male
  1      Edu   74.25   72.05
  2   Income 3994.00 7984.50
  3  LifeExp   74.05   68.30
  4 Literacy   89.20   93.70
				</pre>
				<p>Women have higher median educational involvement rates and life expectancy, but lower median literacy rates, and much lower
				median incomes. Let's compare men and women on each metric.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Create the comparison dataframe<br>
						gender.comp <- cast(gender.m, Country + Measure ~ Gender)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/gendercompare.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/gendercompare.png" width = 60%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					There are a few interesting patterns here. To begin with, it looks mostly like the differences between countries is larger than
					differences within countries. So, countries with high education, for instance, have both high male and female education. There's also apparently
					an artificial clipping of reported male incomes. No country reports a mean male income greater than $40,000. I'll be excluding 
					these and other artificially clipped data points in the following plots.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gender differences within countries are also interesting. The most striking, to my eyes, is that in high education rate countries,
					women have a higher education rate than men, but in lower education rate countries, men have a higher rate than women.
				</p>
				<p>
					We should probably also look at how different measures are correlated with eachother.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						gender.comp2 <- cast(gender.m, Country + Gender ~ Measure)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Let's start with income and life expectancy.
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/income_life.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/income_life.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Unsurprisingly, the greater average income, the greater life expectancy is. Women almost always have a higher life expectancy than men of the same
					average income, but as income increases, life expectancy seems to increase at the same rate for men and women.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, education and literacy!
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_lit.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_lit.png" width = 75%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Unsurprisingly, as education increases, so does literacy. The effect of education on literacy also appears to be the same for both genders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, let's look at the effect of education on income!
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_income1.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_income1.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Now that is a strong interaction. Over all, as education increases, average income increases. However, the effect is stronger for men
					than for women. That is, men get more income bang for their education buck, internationally. For women, the effect of education on income 
					is weaker at the higher education and income end of the spectrum.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can also visualize this effect by connecting the male and female data points within each country.
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_income2.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_income2.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Now, the cross-over pattern in education above makes more sense. The high income countries are also the high education countries, but
					it's in those countries that women need to have proportionally more education to get the same income benefits. The arbitrariness of this
					effect should be clear. Women don't appear to be worse learners, as evidenced by there not being a large gender effect on the direct
					outcome of education, literacy. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, I'm also commiting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy">environmental fallacy</a>, and maybe others.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a name = "peterson_barney"></a>Peterson and Barney</h3>
				<p>
					I'll use this final set of data to demonstrate some useful aggregation utility in <rcode>cast()</rcode>. This data set is acoustic measurements
					of recordings of 8 repitions of 10 vowels by 76 speakers as collected by Peterson and Barney (1952). It can be found here: 
					<a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1">http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					First, let's load it into R and clean it up a bit.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Read in the data<br>
						pb <- read.delim("http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1", header = F)<br>

						## Give meaningful column names<br>
						colnames(pb) <- c("Age","Sex","Speaker","Vowel","V1","F0.hz","F1.hz","F2.hz","F3.hz")<br>

						## Fix up the age data<br>
						levels(pb$Age) <- c("Child","Adult","Adult")<br>
						pb$Age <- relevel(pb$Age, "Adult")

				<p>Next, melt the data.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
