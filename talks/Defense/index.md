# The Data

The data for my dissertation is drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus
    
- Sociolinguistic interviews carried out for the Ling 560 Class
- I'm working with a subset of 735,408 measurements from 308 speakers from the PNC
- Phonetic alignment and formant analysis was automated using [the FAVE suite](http://fave.ling.upenn.edu/).

# The Use of Change in Progress

When we observe a language change in progress, the change is taking place in speakers' knowledge of their language from generation to generation.

- Speakers' supraglottal tracts are not changing meaningfully.
- The speed of sound at sea level isn't changing.
- Speakers' motor-planning abilities aren't changing meaningfully.

To know *which* aspect of their knowledge is changing, we really need to observe the sound change in progress.

---

# The Use of Change in Progress

#### Metathesis

1. It could be lexically gradual, moving one word at a time, possibly due to perceptual confusion (Blevins & Garret 2004)
    * e.g. chipotle -> chipolte
2. It could be due to a new phonological process being added to the grammar, which produces phonetically abrupt variation.
3. It could even be phonetically gradual
    * Andalusian pre-aspiration becoming post aspiration (Parrel, 2012; Ruch 2012)
         * ht > hth > th

In all three cases, the outcome is the same, but result from changes to three very different aspects of linguistic knowledge.

---

# The Theoretical Model

I'll adopt a model more or less similar to those proposed in the 80s and 90s in Generative Phonetics.

# The Theoretical Model

##### Phonetic Implementation 
As a [+back] vowel, /ow/ is mapped to a phonetic target for backness.

![ow_intrisnic](assets/ow_implementation.svg) \

This target can vary cross-dialectally, or change over time.

<p>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![ow_intrisnic](assets/ow_intrinsic1.svg) \
</div>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">

</div>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![ow_intrisnic](assets/ow_intrinsic2.svg) \
</div>
</p>

---

# The Theoretical Model
In different contexts, this target for /ow/ will be subject to different coarticulatory pressures.

<p>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;width:25%;">
![owl_1](assets/owl_1.svg) \
</div>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![owt_1](assets/owt_1.svg) \ 
</div>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

These coarticulatory pressures themselves may be subject to cross-dialectal variation and change (Zsiga 2000).

<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![owl_1](assets/owl_2.svg) \
</div>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![owt_1](assets/owt_1.svg) \ 
</div>

---

# The Theoretical Model
Or, a phonological process may produce an /ow/ allophone with a different target of phonetic implementation.

<div style = "width:100%;float:left;">
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![owl_1](assets/owl_3.svg) \
</div>
<div style="float:left;margin-left:5%;">
![owt_1](assets/owt_1.svg) \ 
</div>
</div>



##### Phonetic Variants
Shared target of phonetic implementation, perturbed by coarticulatory pressures.

##### Phonological Variants
Different surface phonological representations, thus different phonetic targets.

# Modeling the Rate of Change
 
By trying to see where in the course of a sound change the rates of change of vowel variants diverge, we can see when phonological reanalysis occurred.

For this analysis, I looked at three vowels: /aw/, /ow/ and /uw/

</div>

</div>

---

# Modeling the Rate of Change

Since the trajectories of change of these vowels are clearly not linear, or even monotonic, I had to do something more complicated than linear regression.

##### Basic Model

<ul class = "incremental">
<li> I modeled year-over-year change as a latent variable, which I call &delta;</li>
<li> The estimated target for a given birth year is the sum of &delta; from the earliest DOB up until the year in question. I'm calling that value &Delta;</li>
<li>I modeled each speaker's target as being normally distributed around the &Delta; for their DOB (a &mu; for each speaker.)</li>
<li>The data from each speaker is normally distributed around their &mu;.</li>
<li>There are also words specific random effects, normally distributed around 0.</li>
</ul>


---

# Modeling the Rate of Change

For modeling the year-over-year change (&delta;), I used b-splines.







<div class="scianimator">
<div id="b_spline_animation" style="display: inline-block;">
</div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function($) {
    $(document).ready(function() {
      var imgs = Array(22);
      for (i=0; ; i++) {
        if (i == imgs.length) break;
        imgs[i] = "figure/b_spline_animation" + (i + 1) + ".svg";
      }
      $("#b_spline_animation").scianimator({
          "images": imgs,
          "delay": 1000,
          "controls": ["first", "previous", "play", "next", "last", "loop", "speed"],
      });
      $("#b_spline_animation").scianimator("play");
    });
  })(jQuery);
</script>

# Modeling the Rate of Change

The model was implemented in Stan, which estimates Bayesian models like this via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

* Each model was fit with 3 chains, with a burn in of 750 iterations. These models converged very quickly.
* Convergence was evaluated using the Gelman-Rubin Diagonstic

# Modeling the Rate of Change

According to the model:

<table>

<tr>
  <td>
    Year when /ow/ rate of change first &gt; 0:
  </td>
  <td>
1906
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    Year when /ow/ rate of change first &ne; /owL/ rate of change:
  </td>
  <td>
1908
  </td>
</tr>

</table>

This difference is smaller than the possible precision of the model.

# Modeling the Rate of Change

#### Wrapup
For all of these vowel variants, I found only one case that fit the quantitative profile of phonological reanalysis, and even that is not clear cut.

I also found two cases which were categorically exempt from their sound change from its onset, which is not predicted under the gradual reanalysis account.


---

# Mismatches

The model of gradual reanalysis would predict that phonetic changes should progress from the most favoring environment to the least. 

In some cases, there is a mismatch between contexts which phonetically favor a change, and the eventual phonological conditioning in its outcome.

# Mismatches
#### Wrapup

Phonetic favoribility is a weak predictor of which variants will undergo a change.

First is not fastest.

*Phonological* conditioning is present at the onset of these changes.


---

# Conclusions and Analysis

The conventional wisdom regarding the gradual phonological reanalysis of phonetic effects:

1. Either doesn't happen, or happens too rarely to be observed in the sound changes I've analyzed.
2. Can't account for a number of the patterns in sound changes that I've observed.
3. My proposal that phonetic changes operate over surface phonological representations makes additional predictions which are borne out (e.g. parallel phonetic shifts of phonological natural classes).

---

# Conclusions and Analysis

I have observed that when there is clear phonological conditioning of a sound change towards its end, that phonological conditioning is also in place at the sound change's onset.

#### Proposal

New phonological processes enter the grammar as strictly phonological innovations, not reanalyses of phonetic processes, and have relatively small phonetic correlates at first. This is similar to the "Big Bang" theory of Joseph & Janda.

---

# Is this Plausible?

There are plenty of examples children briefly entertaining phonological hypotheses which are markedly absent from the adult grammar, like Consonant Harmony.

# Conclusions

* A model of phonetic change taking into account a strong but distinct role of phonology does a better job analyzing and predicting the observed patterns of sound change than one without.
* The study of sound change in progress offers unique insight into the interrelationship between phonology and phonetics, and vice versa.
* My proposal, and is consequences for understanding sound change introduces many more interesting questions and avenues of research.
