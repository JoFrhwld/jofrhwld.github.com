		<h2><a href="recontrast.R"><b>Download</b></a></h2>
		<p>You can download the script here and source it locally, or source it directly from
		this location with the following command:
		<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier">
					source("http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/scripts/recontrast.R")
				</font>
		</blockquote>
		
		</p>
		<h2>Usage:</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier">
					recontrast(x, type = "sum")
				</font>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<font face = "Courier">x</font> can be a data frame, or a factor. If given a data frame, <font face = "Courier">recontrast()</font>
				will change the contrasts for all unordered factors with < 1000 levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				As of now, <font face = "Courier">recontrast()</font> will generate sum and treatment contrasts if you pass <font face = "Courier">"sum"</font> 
				or <font face = "Courier">"treatment"</font> to <font face = "Courier">type</font>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The output of <font face = "Courier">recontrast()</font> is either a factor with the new contrasts, or a data frame with all of its 
				factor columns given the specified contrasts
			</p>
		<h2>Motivations</h2>
			<p>See <a href = "http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/rstudy/week5.html#contrasts">here</a> for a discussion of contrasts with sample data.</p>
			<p>By default, R sets up <b>treatment contrasts</b> for categorical factors. Treatment contrasts assume that some level (the first one) is untreated,
			or default with respect to the response. The reported effects for the treated levels are their differences from the default group. For
			experimental data, where there is one control group and many experimental groups, treatment contrasts are obviously the most appropriate.
			For some linguistic data, treatment contrasts can also be appropriate. For example, if you assume that for some variation a lingual
			articulation will introduce a bias, but a labial articulation will not, you can treat the labial articulation as "untreated."</p>
			
			<p>However, the assumption of an untreated group is inappropriate for a lot of linguistic data, and the comparision of all levels to some reference 
			level is uninteresting. <b>Sum contrasts</b> are another way of setting up comparisons in the model, where reported coefficients for each level
			represent the difference of that level from the mean of the response variable. Sum contrasts are the standard kind of contrasts used in sociolinguistic 
			research. In fact, they are the only kind of contrast one can use in GoldVarb (with centered factors). They are so called because the sum of all
			effects is 0 when reported in log-odds (they average to 0.5 when reported as "factor weights," the inverse logit of the log-odds coefficients).</p>
			
			<p>So why write a script to change the contrasts, when we could change the default options in R about what kinds of contrasts to automatically
			generate, or we could just use <font face = "Courier">contr.sum()</font> and <font face = "Courier">contr.treatment()</font> on a factor
			by factor basis? The primary reason is that the output of <font face = "Courier">contr.sum()</font> is this:
			<xmp>
	> contr.sum(levels(td$PreSeg))
	          [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
	fricative    1    0    0    0
	l            0    1    0    0
	nasal        0    0    1    0
	obstruent    0    0    0    1
	sibilant    -1   -1   -1   -1
			</xmp>
			Whereas the output of <font face = "Courier">contr.treatment()</font> is this:
			<xmp>
	> contr.treatment(levels(td$PreSeg))
	          l nasal obstruent sibilant
	fricative 0     0         0        0
	l         1     0         0        0
	nasal     0     1         0        0
	obstruent 0     0         1        0
	sibilant  0     0         0        1
			</xmp>
			The crucial difference here is that <font face = "Courier">contr.treatment()</font> names the columns of the contrasts matrix, but 
			<font face = "Courier">contr.sum()</font> doesn't.  This means that if we were to fit a model with <font face = "Courier">PreSeg</font> with
			treatment contrasts, the coefficients would be meaningfully named, like <font face = "Courier">PreSegnasal</font>. Fitting the model with
			sum contrasts would just number the coefficients, returning a non-meaningfully named <font face = "Courier">PreSeg3</font>.
			</p>
			<p><font face = "Courier">recontrast()</font> names the columns of sum contrasts matrix, so that models fit with these factors
			will be more readable. It also operates over factors and data frames, which are the important conceptual units of model fitting.</p>
			
		<h2>Words of Warning</h2>
			<p>If you change, reorder, or eliminate levels of a factor, it will be necessary to reconstruct the contrasts for that factor again with
			<font face = "Courier">recontrast()</font>.</p>
