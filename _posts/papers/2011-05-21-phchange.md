title: "Phonetic Change and Phonology"
year: 2011
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/" }]
abstract: "In this paper, I will attempt to support the following two arguments
			<ol>
			<li>Phonetic change is a distinct type of language change, displaying qualitatively different dynamics from syntactic, morphological, and phonological change.</li>
			<li>However, there is good evidence that categorical phonology
				plays a crucial role in the mediation of phonetic change.</li>
			</ol>
			I will propose that a model of phonetic change which adequately
			captures these effects, describes it as a change in language specific
			phonetic implementation of phonological objects. Phonetic change,
			then, can be localized to the implementation of particular phonological features, or bundle of features. I will conclude with some remarks
			about the consequences of this model for the nature of phonological
			representation."
