abstract: "Bakovic (2005) proposes that patterns of sufficiently-similar segment
 			avoidance are the result of interacting agreement and antigemination
			 constraints, a pattern known as cross-derivational feeding
 			(CDF). The bleeding interactions between epenthesis and assimilation
 			which prevent adjacent sufficiently-similar segments in
 			English are shown to follow, however, from extragrammatical considerations.
 			Several case studies provide evidence against the major
 			predictions of CDF."
