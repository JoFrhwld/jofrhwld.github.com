title: "Phonology has an Early Infuence on Sound Change"
year: 2012
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/" }]
abstract: "The consensus view of conditioned sound changes is that they begin as low-level phonetic biases which become compounded in the production-perception feedback loop (Ohala, 1981; Pierrehumbert, 2002; Blevins, 2004; Bermudez-Otero, 2007, inter alia). I argue against this consensus view that, instead, the conditioning on sound changes is phonological from the very onset of the change. To support this argument, I present a detailed analysis of a conditioned sound change, the raising of /ay/ before voiceless segments in Philadelphia."
