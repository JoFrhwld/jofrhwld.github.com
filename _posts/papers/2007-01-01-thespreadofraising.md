title: "The Spread of Raising: Opacity, Lexicalization, and diffusion"
year: 2007
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/" }]
abstract: "Canadian Raising is typically described as the centralization of the nucleus of /ay/ before voiceless segments. 
			However some recent studies in areas affected by Raising have shown that the current conditioning factors are 
			not as regular as reported previously (Vance, 1987; Dailey-OCain, 1997; Hall, 2005). This paper explores the status
			of Raising in Philadelphia. Examining data from 12 boys, ages 14 to 19, it appears that Raising has lexicalized 
			here as well. While Raising occurs before a number of voiced stops and nasals, the words which experience Raising 
			most regularly suggest that it has spread due to its opaque applications."
