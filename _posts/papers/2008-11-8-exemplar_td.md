title: "Evaluation and simulation of exemplar theoretic -t/-d deletion"
year: 2008
author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/" }]
abstract: "I evaluate a model of TD-Deletion where the morphological effect is generated by an Exemplar Theoretic
		production-perception feedback loop like proposed in Bybee (2002). I find that 1) it is insufficient to
		produce morphological differences of the required magnitude and 2) that it produces the wrong shape of 
		linguistic change. Most language change follows an S-shaped curve, while the production-perception
		feedback loop produces exponential decay."
