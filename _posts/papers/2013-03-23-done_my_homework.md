abstract: "We present an analysis of an underdescribed construction common to Canadian and Philadelphian English dialects which appears to involve an instance of the copula/passive auxiliary be, a participial form of finish or do, and a DP complement receiving accusative Case (see Yerastov (2008) for a descriprition and discussion of its geographical distribution). This construction, which is fully productive and non-idiomatic, is illustrated in (1).
<ol>
	<li>I'm finished/done my homework.</li>
</ol>
This construction raises a number of problems for the theory of Case-assignment and argument structure, including
<ol start=2>
	<li>
		<ol type='a'>
		<li>What is the category of the phrase headed by the participle?</li>
		<li>Where is the external argument introduced?</li>
		<li>Where does the accusative Case of the internal argument come from, given the apparently passive structure.</li>
		<li>Why is this construction lexically restricted to the participles of <i>finish</i> and <i>do</i>.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
We argue that the structure for (1) is given in (3).
<ol start = 3>
	<li>
		<br><img src = '../assets/done_my_homework_tree.png'></img>
	</li>
</ol>
The answers to questions (2a-2d) are then
<ol start = 4>
	<li>
		<ol type = 'a'>
			<li>The construction involves a resultative adjectival passive, rather than a full eventive passive or an active past participle (i.e. there is no Voice head)</li>
			<li>The external argument is therefore introduced not in spec-VoiceP (which is absent) but in the subject position of the adjectival small clause (which we depict here as spec-aP).</li>
			<li>The accusative Case of the internal argument is assigned by a little-a head, perhaps similar to the little-a head which assigns accusative case to the objects of worth.</li>
			<li>The lexical specificity of this construction is due to the selectional properties of this little-a head.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
