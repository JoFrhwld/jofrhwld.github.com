I'm pleased to announce that the Penn Working Papers in Linguistics volume 18.1 has just been published today. Volume 18.1 is the proceedings of [PLC 35](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/PLC/PLC35/). I was both the issue editor for 18.1 (that's a roving duty that Penn Linguistics graduate students carry out), and had [a paper in this volume](http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss1/10/).

You can download and read all of the papers free of charge [here](http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss1/).
