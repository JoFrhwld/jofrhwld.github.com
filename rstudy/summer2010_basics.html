				<h2><a name = "intro"></a>Intro</h2>
				<p>
					The goal for this section will be to get you comfortable with futzing through R. For the most part, these notes are pulled together from
					<a href="week1.html">Week 1</a> and <a href="week2.html">Week 2</a> of the previous R Study Group notes. I'll only be going through this
					material for one week, so that we can get directly to the more advanced stuff.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To practice data input-output from your local computer, download and unzip the data from Keith Johnson's book <i>Quantitative Methods
					in Linguistics.</i> <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/46/14051442/DOWNLOAD/3phonetics.rar">Here</a>[ZIP]
				</p>
				
				<h2><a name = "vectors_and_assignment"></a>Vectors and Assignment</h2>
				<p>
					Vectors are the most basic data types you'll work with in R, and assignment of values to variables is the most basic operation
					you'll utilize.
				</p>
					<h3><a name = "vectors"></a>Vectors</h3>
					<p>
					 	Vectors are essentially lists of data, and can contain characters, numbers, or TRUE FALSE values, but not mixed types.
						There are a number of ways to create vectors in R, and frequently doing data manipulation will produce subvectors of data. 
						The table below has some commands for creating vectors.</p>
						<center>
						<table border = 1>
							<tr>
								<td><rcode>1:10</rcode></td><td>This produces a vector of integers from 1 to 10.<br>
																				Reversing the order of the numbers will produce a vector of decreasing values</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><rcode>c(...)</rcode></td><td>This produces a vector of whatever is passed as an argument to 
																				<rcode>c()</frcode>.<br>
																				e.g. <rcode>c(1,2,3,4)</rcode></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
									<td><rcode>seq(from,to,...)</rcode></td><td>This produces a sequence of numbers either by a given
																					increment or evenly spaced to a given length.<br>
																					<rcode>seq(1,10,by=0.5)<br>
																					seq(1,10,length=11)<rcode></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><rcode>rep(x,...)</rcode></td><td>This produces a vector of repetitions of <rcode>x</rcode> by
																						a given number of times.<br>
																						<rcode>rep(1,6)<br>
																						rep(1:3,2)<br>
																						rep("hello world",4)</frcode></td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						</center>
						<p> 
							Mixed type vectors will automatically be simplified to the least restrictive type.  Boolean logical values will be simplified to 
							numerical 1's and 0's in a mixed vector with numbers, and everything will be simplified to chracter strings in a mixed vector with 
							characters.  This problem will usually need to be addressed when loading poorly fomatted data into R. (For more marginal problems of 
							dealing with integers vs. floating points, see 
							<a href="http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/03/when-is-a-zero-not-a-zero.html">here</a>.)
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Here's a tip for converting a vector of <rcode>True False</rcode> values to 1's and 0's (sometimes people want to do this).
						</p>
						
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								x <- sample(c(T,F), 20, replace = T)</br>
								x*1
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
						
						<h3><a name = "assignment"></a>Assignment</h3>
						<p>The assignment operator in R is <rcode><-</rcode> or <rcode>-></rcode>
							The following are equivalent assignments:
							<blockquote>
								<rcode>
									x <- 1:10 <br>
									1:10 ->x<br>
								</rcode>
							</blockquote>
							The variable <rcode>x</rcode> now represents the vector of integers from 1 to 10.  Variables in R are case sensitive, 
							so if you assign something to <rcode>x</rcode> you have not assigned it to <rcode>X</rcode>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also note that functions and operations never directly modify variables.  Below we discuss some vector arithmetic.  The operation
							<rcode>x*2</rcode> does not modify <rcode>x</rcode>, but rather produces output which can be assigned to
							a new variable, or back to the original variable.  Without assigning the output of a function or operation to some variable, 
							that output is not available in any way to further computation.
							<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								x<br>
								x*3<br>
								x*3->x<br>
								x<br>
							</rcode>
							</blockquote> 
						</p>
						
						<h3><a name = "vector_arithmetic"></a>Vector Arithmetic</h3>
						<p>
							Just like you can carry out arithmetic functions on numbers, you can do the same to vectors. In fact, single numbers are treated 
							as vectors of length 1, so all arithmetic is actually vector arithmetic. The arithmetic functions in R 
							(even <rcode>* /</rcode>) are all element-wise.
							<blockquote>
								<rcode>
									x <- 1:10 <br>
									x<br>
									x+1<br>				
									x*2<br>				 
									x^2<br>				
									x/3<br>				 
									log(x)<br>
								</rcode>
							</blockquote>
						You can also do arithmetic operations on two multilength vectors.  R will repeat the smaller vector so it is the same length as the 
						larger vector.
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								x*x<br>
								x+x<br><br>
								y<-c(1,2)<br>
								x*y<br>
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
						If the smaller vector is not a multiple of the larger vector, you will still get output, but R will print a warning.
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								x<-rep(1,10)<br>
								y <- c(1,2,3)<br>
								x*y<br>
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
				
					<h3>Indexing<a name = "indexing"></a></h3>
					<p>Elements in a vector are indexed, and can be referenced by their index. **Note** In R, unlike many languages, indexing begins with 1.
					<blockquote>
						<rcode>
							LETTERS<br>
							LETTERS[1]<br>
							LETTERS[1:4]<br>
							LETTERS[c(1,3,5)]<br>
						</rcode>
					</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also access subvectors using a vector of <rcode>TRUE</rcode> or <rcode>FALSE</rcode> values as an 
						index. Usually, this <rcode>TRUE</rcode>/<rcode>FALSE</rcode> vector will be the same length as the vector 
						it is indexing.
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								t.f<- rep(F,26)<br>
								t.f<br>
								LETTERS[t.f]<br>
								t.f[3]<- T<br>
								LETTERS[t.f]<br>
								<br>
								x<-1:10<br>
								x<br>
								x>5<br>
								x[x>5]<br>
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you use a vector of Boolean values as an index which is shorter than the vector it is indexing, R will repeat it so it is the same 
						length.
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								x[c(T,F)]<br>
								x[c(F,T)]<br>
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
						As might be expected, any vector of Boolean values, if preceded by <rcode>!</rcode> will produce a vector of
						the opposite values.
						<blockquote>
							<rcode>
								t.f<br>
								!t.f<br>
								LETTERS[t.f]<br>
								LETTERS[!t.f]<br>
							</rcode>
						</blockquote>
					</p>

				<h2><a name="IO"></a>Data Input-Output</h2>
				<p>
					Here, we'll talk about how to load data into R, and how to write data back out to a data file.  When loading a data file into R, you are just
					loading it into the R workspace.  Any alterations or modifications you make to the data frame will <em>not</em> be reflected in the file in your
					system, <em>just</em> in the copy in the R workspace.
				</p>
	
				<h3><a name="Input"></a>Input</h3>
				<p>
					For the most part, data that will be loaded into R will be in the form of data tables.  Ideally, they will be plain text, and delimited either 
					by tabs or other whitespace, or by commas (.csv files).
				</p>
	
				<p>
					The two most likely commands to be used will be <rcode>read.delim()</rcode> or <rcode>read.csv()</rcode>.
					<rcode>read.delim()</rcode> is used to read in files delimited by tabs, and <rcode>read.csv()</rcode> for files
					delimited by commas.  Both of these functions assume that the first line is a header.  If this is not the case, then set the option 
					<rcode>header = F</rcode>.  If the file you are looking at is delimited neither by tabs nor by commas, you should try 
					<rcode>read.table()</rcode> (which the first two are based on) with the option <rcode>sep</rcode> given the appropriate delimiter.
					As always see <rcode>?read.table</rcode> for more info on all of these functions.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					These <rcode>read.table</rcode> commands will read in the data as a data frame, a particular data structure in R that we'll talk about below.
					Be sure to assign the output of <rcode>read.table()</rcode> to a variable, or else it will just print the file, and that's no good to no one.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					For example, we could read in the data in cherokeeVOT from Johnson 2008 (
					<a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/46/14051442/DOWNLOAD/3phonetics.zip">here again</a> [ZIP])as follows.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot <- read.delim("PATH/cherokeeVOT.txt")<br>
						#or<br>
						vot <- read.table("PATH/cherokeeVOT.txt",sep = "\t",header = T)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					It appears that on Windows machines, the proper file delimiter is still "/", even though if you copy the path, it will be delimited by "\".  
					If you're copying a path into the prompt with the "\" delimiter, change them all to "/" to successfully load the file. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is also the very handy <rcode>file.choose()</rcode> function, which will open up a file browser for you to navigate to the file.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot <- read.delim(file.choose())
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					I'm not actually a huge fan of the <rcode>file.choose()</rcode> function. If you mess up somewhere along the line, it makes it harder
					to rerun your code. If you insist on using the <rcode>file.choose()</rcode> function, I would suggest assigning the output of 
					<rcode>file.choose()</rcode> to a variable first.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						votPATH <- file.choose()<br>
						vot <- read.delim(votPATH)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
			
				<h3><a name="Output"></a>Output</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to save data a data frame that you've edited or enriched, use <rcode>write.csv()</rcode> or 
					<rcode>write.table()</rcode>.  As the name suggests, <rcode>write.csv()</rcode> writes the data frame to a comma separated file.
					Note, if one of your variables has a comma in it (like "City,State"), do <em>not</em> write to a csv, because it will ruin your life.
					I personally don't like a few of the defualt settings to these commands, so here's what I change:
					<dl>
						<dt><rcode>sep</rcode></dt><dd>-- If using <rcode>write.table()</rcode>, I set this to "\t", which writes a 
														tab delimied file.  The default is a single space: " "</dd>
						<dt><rcode>quote</rcode></dt><dd>-- I set this to F.  By default, character strings, and the character labels for factors will
														be closed in quotes.  I don't like this so much, and it makes it harder to read by eye or for some
														other script.</dd>
						<dt><rcode>row.names</rcode></dt><dd>-- I set this to F. By default, it will write a column for the row names in the data frame.
															These are usually meaningless, just being the row number.</dd>
					</dl>
					The final command will usually look something like this:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						write.delim(vot,file = "PATH/vot.txt",sep = "\t",quote = F,row.names = F)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Again, on a Windows machine, use "/" even though the standard file delimiter is "\".</p>
	
				<h2><a name = "DataFrame"></a>Data Frames</h2>
				<p>
					Data Frames are the format you are most likely to access data from in R.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Lets focus on the Cherokee VOT data from Johnson 2008. To see how many rows and columns it has, use <rcode>nrow()</rcode> 
					and <rcode>ncol()</rcode>.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						ncol(vot)<br>
						nrow(vot)<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					There are 3 variables coded for 44 observations in the data.  To see the column names, which are the same as the variable names here, use
					<rcode>colnames()</rcode>.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						colnames(vot)<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					To see the first 6, or last 6 observations, use <rcode>head()</rcode>and <rcode>tail()</rcode>
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						head(vot)<br>
					</rcode>

				<h3><a name="dataframe_index"></a>Data Frame Indexing and Subsetting</h3>
				<p>
					Indexing in data frames can work almost exactly like it does in matrices.  To see the first 6 rows of a data frame, you can use
					<rcode>head()</rcode> -or- <rcode>data[1:6,]</rcode>
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot[1:6,]<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Likewise, you can see a column either by using <rcode>$</rcode>, or giving the column index, or name.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot[ ,"VOT"]<br>
						head(vot[ ,c("VOT","Consonant","year")])<br>
						head(vot[ ,c("year","VOT","Consonant")])<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Frequently, you might want to pull out subets of the data frame, or subsets of variables based on certain conditons.  There are a few ways to do 
					this. First, you could generate a vector of boolean values, and use this as an index for the data frame.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot$VOT > 100<br>
						vot[vot$VOT > 100,]<br>
						vot[vot$Consonant == "t",]
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
			
				
				<p>If you just want to see variable values for a given factor level, there are at least two ways to do this.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						vot[vot$year == 1971,]$VOT<br>
						#or<br>
						vot$VOT[vot$year == 1971]
					</rcode>

					The first selects a subset of the data frame, then takes the VOT variable from that subset.  The second takes the variable first, the takes 
					a subset of that. I'm not sure if one approach is more efficient, common or preferable than the other.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					You could also use <rcode>subset()</rcode> function.  It takes a data frame as its first argument, a conditional expression as its,
					second, and an optional selection argument, which takes a vector of variable names to return as an argument
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						subset(vot,VOT>100 & Consonant == "k")<br>
						subset(vot,VOT>100 & Consonant == "k",select = c("VOT","year"))<br><br>
						subset(vot,VOT>100 & Consonant == "k")$VOT
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
	
				<p>
					If you want to save time by not needing to do the <rcode>$</rcode> reference for a data frame you're working with a lot,
					you can use the <rcode>attach()</rcode> command, which will allow you to directly reference the variable names.  Note, however,
					that any type conversions you make to a data frame's variable will not be reflected in the attached version.  Once you've finished using 
					the data frame, you can remove it from the search path with <rcode>detach()</rcode>.

				<h2><a name = "Factors"></a>Factors</h2>
				<p>
					For the most part, if we're using data which has some variable coded as a character string, it is actually a <em>factor</em> with
					specific <em>levels</em>.
				</p>  

				<p>
					A good way to grasp the structure of factors is to build one from scratch.  Say we had collected class data in a study, 
					and coded lower working class, upper working class, and lower middle class with numeric codes, 1, 2, and 3, repectively.
					First, lets simulate a sample of 10 speakers.  <rcode>sample()</rcode> will simulate such a sample.  See
					<rcode>?sample</rcode> for more details.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						class <- sample(1:3, 10, replace = T)<br>
						class
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
					Your numbers will probably be different.  Right now, <rcode>class</rcode> is a numerical vector.  The 
					<rcode>factor()</rcode> function will convert it to a factor vector.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						factor(class)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
		
				<p>
					We can also add meaninful labels to the factor levels.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						class.f<-factor(class,labels = c("LWC","UWC","LMC"))<br>
						class.f
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In essence, the factor vector has a representation like this:
				</p>
				<center>
					<table border = 1>
						<tr><th>Vector</th><th>Dictionary</th></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td><td>1 = "LWC"</td></tr>
						<tr><td>1</td><td>2 = "UWC"</td></tr>
						<tr><td>1</td><td>3 = "LMC"</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2</td></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td></tr>
						<tr><td>2</td></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td></tr>
						<tr><td>3</td></tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				<p>
					Compare the following printed output
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						class<br>
						class.l<-c("LWC","UWC","LMC")<br>
						class.l<br>
						class.l[class]<br>
						class.f<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The factor vector that we built is unordered.  That is, the factor levels define groups rather than an ordering.  It is possible to also
					define ordered factors, which will strongly affect model fitting.  I haven't used ordered factors much myself, so I don't really understand how 
					they work (but I should).
				</p>
		
				<h3><a name="levels()"></a><rcode>levels()</rcode></h3>
				<p>
					The <rcode>levels()</rcode> command accesses the levels of a factor.  It will either produce a character vector
					of the current levels, or allow you to edit the levels by assigning a new character vector to it.
					<blockquote>
						<rcode>
							> levels(class.f)
							> old.levels<-levels(class.f)
							> new.levels <- c("LowerWorkingClass","UpperWorkingClass","LowerMiddleClass")<br>
							> levels(class.f)<-new.levels<br>
							> class.f<br>
						</rcode>
					</blockquote> 
				</p>
		
				<h3><a name = "relevel"></a><rcode>relevel()</rcode></h3>
				<p>
					<em><b>Don't</b></em> use <rcode>levels()</rcode> to try to change the order of levels. Here's a demonstration of what will happen
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						x <- factor(1:3, labels = c("one","two","three"))<br>
						x<br>
						levels(x) <- c("two","one","three")<br>
						x<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					All we've done is change the labels of each level, which ends up scrambling their meaningful labels. If we really wanted
					"two" to be the first level (this will be important for fitting regression models), we should use <rcode>relevel()</rcode>.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						x <- factor(1:3, labels = c("one","two","three"))<br>
						x<br>
						x <- relevel(x, "two")<br>
						x<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>		
				<p>
					<rcode>relevel()</rcode> has reordered the levels, making "two" the first one, but has kept the labels for each level the same.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a name = "reorder"></a><rcode>reorder()</rcode></h3>
				<p>
					There is also a pretty nifty function called <rcode>reorder()</rcode> which will reorder the levels of a factor
					according to their values on some other dimension,
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						x <- as.factor(c(rep("A",10),rep("B",10)))<br>
						value <- c(rnorm(10,mean = 1), rnorm(10, mean = -1))<br>
						tapply(value, x, mean)<br>
						<br>
						x <- reorder(x, value, mean)<br>
						tapply(value, x, mean)
					</rcode>
