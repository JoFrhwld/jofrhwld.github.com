				<h2><a name = "intro"></a>Intro</h2>
				<p>
					Effectively deploying <rcode>plyr</rcode> functions, and soon enough producing graphics in <rcode>ggplot2</rcode>, relies pretty
					heavilly upon having data in a particular format. However, perhaps it's not always possible to appropriately format data as you
					collect it, and frequently we inherit data from other sources and researchers who had different concerns when putting together their data.
					Here, we'll discuss how the <rcode>reshape</rcode> package can help us reformat data into other forms.
				</p>
				<p>
					My approach to this topic will be mostly examples based.
				</p>
				<h2><a name = "reshape_package"></a> <rcode>reshape</rcode> Package</h2>
				<p>
					The webpage for the <rcode>reshape</rcode> package is located here: <a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/">http://had.co.nz/reshape/</a>. The
					<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v21/i12">suggested documentation</a> on that page is pretty good.
				</p>
				
				<h2><a name = "us_war_casualties"></a>US War Casualties</h2>
				<p>
					The first set of data we'll look at comes was linked to by a post on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">Guardian Data Blog</a>.
					<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/sep/17/afghanistan-casualties-dead-wounded-british-data">The post</a> is about British casualties 
					in Afghanistan, but we'll be looking at data on US war casualties. That data is located here: 
					<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=phNtm3LmDZEP-WVJJxqgYfA#gid=0">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=phNtm3LmDZEP-WVJJxqgYfA#gid=0</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, this data is going to require some processing before it's in a workable format, and a lot of that will probably be easier in the text editor
					of your choice. Download the data from Google Docs as a txt file, then follow these steps in a text editor.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Delete the first line</li>
					<li>Delete final 6 lines, starting with "ROUNDING ADJUSTMENTS</li>
					<li>Search and replace all commas with nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all quotes with nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all hyphens wth nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all parentheses with nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all spaces with periods</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					We still need to code which country the data is coming from into the column names. In principle, it might be a good idea to do this by
					hand in the raw data. However, we can also do it in a more automated way in R. Save the above changes, then load the data into R using
					<rcode>read.delim()</rcode>. Be sure to set <rcode>check.names = F</rcode> in <rcode>read.delim()</rcode>. We have a number of 
					columns which have the same names. Ordinarily, this would be bad, and by default R would fix it for us, but for our present purposes we want
					to leave them as-is.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						# Append "Afghanistan_" to the Afghanistan data<br>
						colnames(casualties)[2:5] <- paste("Afghanistan", colnames(casualties)[2:5], sep = "_")<br>
						<br>
						#Append "Iraq_" to the Iraq data<br>
						colnames(casualties)[6:9] <- paste("Iraq", colnames(casualties)[6:9], sep = "_")<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The next step is to "melt" the data with the <rcode>reshape::melt()</rcode> function. The arguments that <rcode>melt()</rcode> takes 
					are:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><rcode>data</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The data frame containing the data.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>id.vars</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The columns which define the id variables</dd>
					<dt><rcode>measure.vars</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The columns which define measure variables. By default, it assumes all non-id variables are measure variables</dd>
					<dt><rcode>variable_name</rcode></dt>
						<dd>What you want to call the new variable column. The default is "variable", which is pretty fine.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					For this casualties data, the only id variable defined in a column is <rcode>STATE</rcode>. The other id variable is
					which country the data came from, which is unfortunately spread out along the columns.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						# melt the data<br>
						# 1 indicates the column index<br>
						casualties.m <- melt(casualties, id = 1, na.rm = T)<br>
						<br>
						# this is an equivalent call to melt()<br>
						casualties.m <- melt(casualties, id = "STATE", na.rm = T)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The resulting <rcode>casualties.m</rcode> data frame should look something like this:
				</p>
				<pre>
             STATE                 variable value
  1        ALABAMA Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD     8
  2         ALASKA Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD     1
  3 AMERICAN.SAMOA Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD     1
  4        ARIZONA Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD    19
  5       ARKANSAS Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD     5
  6     CALIFORNIA Afghanistan_HOSTILE.DEAD    75 
				</pre>
				<p>
					The column <rcode>variable</rcode> contains the measure column names from <rcode>casualties</rcode>, and <rcode>value</rcode>
					contains the value from the cell corresponding the rows defined by the id variables, and the column defined by <rcode>variable</rcode>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We haven't got this data in a very usable format yet. We need to separate the country information from the casualty type information.
					We'll do this by using <rcode>reshape::colsplit()</rcode>. Using <rcode>colsplit()</rcode> alone will split a given vector along a
					specific character, and will return a data frame with however many columns this splitting creates. We'll add these new columns back onto the 
					original data frame with <rcode>base::cbind()</rcode>.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Let's just see what colsplit() produces<br>
						head(colsplit(casualties.m$variable, split = "_", names = c("Country","Type")))<br>
						<br>
						## Add these results back onto the dataframe<br>
						casualties.m <- cbind(casualties.m, colsplit(casualties.m$variable, split = "_", names = c("Country","Type")))<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Now that we have the data in this format, we can recast the data into almost any shape, including various aggregations.
					The function to recast data is called <rcode>reshape::cast()</rcode>. It takes the following arguments:
				</p>
					<dl>
					<dt><rcode>data</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The data frame containing molten data.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>formula</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The casting formula. Variables to the left of the <rcode>~</rcode> define rows, and variables 
						to the right define columns. A pipe (<rcode>|</rcode>) following the formula defines subsets.</dd>
					<dt><rcode>value</rcode></dt>
						<dd>The column to treat as the value. By default, it assumes that a column named "<rcode>value</rcode>"
						is the value column</dd>
					<dt><rcode>fun.aggregate</rcode></dt>
						<dd>aggregation function</dd>
					<dt><rcode>margins</rcode></dt>
						<dd>Which margins to calculate grand summaries for</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					So, if we want to just see how many states we have observations for for each country and casualty type, we can use
					the following code:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(casualties.m, Type ~ Country)<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
  Aggregation requires fun.aggregate: length used as default
                      Type Afghanistan Iraq
  1           HOSTILE.DEAD          53   56
  2 HOSTILE.WOUNDED.ACTUAL          56   56
  3    HOSTILE.WOUNDED.EST          52   55
  4        NONHOSTILE.DEAD          50   55
					
				</pre>
				<p>
					As <rcode>cast()</rcode> warns us, we didn't define an aggregation function, so it uses <rcode>length()</rcode>, or
					the number of observations for each combination of casualty type and country. It looks as if we have data from 56 states 
					(the 50 states proper, plus 5 territories and Washington D.C.). However, many states don't have reported data for some
					casualty types for one or more of the countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can also use <rcode>cast()</rcode> to calculate total casualties, and median casualties using different aggregation functions.
					I'll also add column grand summaries.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Total casualties<br>
						cast(casualties.m, Type ~ Country, fun = sum, margins = "grand_col")
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
                      Type Afghanistan  Iraq (all)
  1           HOSTILE.DEAD         731  3461  4192
  2 HOSTILE.WOUNDED.ACTUAL        4263 27817 32080
  3    HOSTILE.WOUNDED.EST         924  3853  4777
  4        NONHOSTILE.DEAD         272   899  1171
				</pre>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Median Casualties by State<br>
						cast(casualties.m, Type ~ Country, fun = median, margins = "grand_col")
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
                      Type Afghanistan Iraq
  1           HOSTILE.DEAD         9.0   47
  2 HOSTILE.WOUNDED.ACTUAL        48.5  379
  3    HOSTILE.WOUNDED.EST        12.5   53
  4        NONHOSTILE.DEAD         4.0   10
				</pre>
				<p>
					Overall, the Iraq war has been deadlier. We can also compare this at a state by state level.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Create a data frame for comparison<br>
						## If the combination of ID and measure variables <br>
						## &nbsp;&nbsp;produces cells which all only have 1 observation, <br>
						## &nbsp;&nbsp;cast will fill the cells with that value<br>
						casualties.comp <- cast(casualties.m, STATE + Type ~ Country)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/warcompare.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/warcompare.png" width = 60%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					You might also want to compare how one kind of casualty is related to another.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						casualties.comp2 <- cast(casualties.m, STATE + Country  ~ Type)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/casualtycompare.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/casualtycompare.png" width = 60%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					As a final exercise, we might try using the pipe syntax in <rcode>cast()</rcode>. This will produce a list of data frames, 
					where every element in the list is defined by the variables following the pipe.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Using the pipe syntax<br>
						casualties.list <- cast(casualties.m, STATE ~ Country | Type)<br>
						<br>
						## Just print all of casualties.list, or<br>
						## &nbsp;&nbsp;plot some if it<br>
						qplot(Iraq, Afghanistan, data = casualties.list$HOSTILE.DEAD)<br>
						<br>
						qplot(Iraq, Afghanistan, data = casualties.list$NONHOSTILE.DEAD)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					It might also help, conceptually, if we recreated the format that the Gaurdian published the data in.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(casualties.m, STATE ~ Country + Type)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					It might be useful for you to think about the way you structure your data in terms of a <rcode>cast()</rcode> formula, per 
					our <a href="summer2010_general_data_structure.html">general discussion</a> of data structure.
				</p>
				
				<h2><a name = "gender_gap"></a>Gender Gap</h2>
				<p>
					This next data set also comes from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/gender-educationsgendergap">a post</a> 
					to the Guardian Data blog about gender inequality. You can find the data here: 
					<a href="http://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=phNtm3LmDZENDfX6fD5PSMw#gid=0">http://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=phNtm3LmDZENDfX6fD5PSMw#gid=0</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, we'll do some pre-processing in a text editor. Download the data from Google spreadsheets, then perform the following steps
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Delete the first 8 lines, so that the first line starts "Afghanistan"</li>
					<li>Delete the final 3 lines, so that the last line starts "Zimbabwe"</li>
					<li>Search and replace all commas with nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all quotes with nothing</li>
					<li>Search and replace all spaces with periods</li>
					<li>Search and replace all double tabs with single tabs</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Like before, we'll add in the column names in R. I did this part by hand, but it's easier for us all to recreate the same steps
					if we just copy my code below. Read in the data with <rcode>read.delim()</rcode>, being sure to set <rcode>header = F</rcode> and
					<rcode>na.strings = ".."</rcode>. The next block of code will rename the columns appropriately.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						colnames(gender) <- c("Country", "LifeExp_Female", "LifeExp_Male", "Literacy_Female", 
"Literacy_Male", "Edu_Female", "Edu_Male", "Income_Female", "Income_Male", 
"Parliament", "Legislators", "Professional", "IncomeRatio")<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Looking at the data, there are really two kinds of data sets here. The first compares the status of men and women on a number of different
					metrics, and the other looks strictly at metrics about women's placement in societies. For our purpose, we'll focus on the former.
					So, the following code takes the correct subset.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						 ## Only keep the relevant columns<br>
						 gender1 <- gender[, c(1,2:9)]<br>
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Now, like before, we want to melt the data, then use <rcode>colsplit()</rcode> to split appart the
					measurement data from the gender data.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						 ## Melt the data!<br>
						 gender.m <- melt(gender1, id = 1, na.rm = T)<br>
						 <br>
						 ## Split the variable column!<br>
						 gender.m <- cbind(gender.m, colsplit(gender.m$variable, split = "_", names = c("Measure","Gender")))
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Now we can do some serious stuff. Let's start by checking how balanced the observations are.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(gender.m, Measure ~ Gender)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
  Aggregation requires fun.aggregate: length used as default
     Measure Female Male
  1      Edu    178  178
  2   Income    174  174
  3  LifeExp    194  194
  4 Literacy    171  171
				</pre>
				<p>
					All contries in the sample have life expectancy data, but no other metric has data from all other countries
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let's look at median values for each measure.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(gender.m, Measure ~ Gender, fun = median)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<pre>
     Measure  Female    Male
  1      Edu   74.25   72.05
  2   Income 3994.00 7984.50
  3  LifeExp   74.05   68.30
  4 Literacy   89.20   93.70
				</pre>
				<p>Women have higher median educational involvement rates and life expectancy, but lower median literacy rates, and much lower
				median incomes. Let's compare men and women on each metric.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Create the comparison dataframe<br>
						gender.comp <- cast(gender.m, Country + Measure ~ Gender)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/gendercompare.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/gendercompare.png" width = 60%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					There are a few interesting patterns here. To begin with, it looks mostly like the differences between countries is larger than
					differences within countries. So, countries with high education, for instance, have both high male and female education. There's also apparently
					an artificial clipping of reported male incomes. No country reports a mean male income greater than $40,000. I'll be excluding 
					these and other artificially clipped data points in the following plots.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gender differences within countries are also interesting. The most striking, to my eyes, is that in high education rate countries,
					women have a higher education rate than men, but in lower education rate countries, men have a higher rate than women.
				</p>
				<p>
					We should probably also look at how different measures are correlated with eachother.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						gender.comp2 <- cast(gender.m, Country + Gender ~ Measure)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Let's start with income and life expectancy.
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/income_life.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/income_life.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Unsurprisingly, the greater average income, the greater life expectancy is. Women almost always have a higher life expectancy than men of the same
					average income, but as income increases, life expectancy seems to increase at the same rate for men and women.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, education and literacy!
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_lit.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_lit.png" width = 75%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Unsurprisingly, as education increases, so does literacy. The effect of education on literacy also appears to be the same for both genders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, let's look at the effect of education on income!
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_income1.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_income1.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Now that is a strong interaction. Over all, as education increases, average income increases. However, the effect is stronger for men
					than for women. That is, men get more income bang for their education buck, internationally. For women, the effect of education on income 
					is weaker at the higher education and income end of the spectrum.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can also visualize this effect by connecting the male and female data points within each country.
				</p>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/edu_income2.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/edu_income2.png" width = 70%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					Now, the cross-over pattern in education above makes more sense. The high income countries are also the high education countries, but
					it's in those countries that women need to have proportionally more education to get the same income benefits. The arbitrariness of this
					effect should be clear. Women don't appear to be worse learners, as evidenced by there not being a large gender effect on the direct
					outcome of education, literacy. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, I'm also commiting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy">environmental fallacy</a>, and maybe others.
				</p>
				
				<h2><a name = "peterson_barney"></a>Peterson and Barney</h2>
				<p>
					I'll use this final set of data to demonstrate some useful aggregation utility in <rcode>cast()</rcode>. This data set is acoustic measurements
					of recordings of 8 repitions of 10 vowels by 76 speakers as collected by Peterson and Barney (1952). It can be found here: 
					<a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1">http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					First, let's load it into R and clean it up a bit.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						## Read in the data<br>
						pb <- read.delim("http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/pb.Table1", header = F)<br>
						<br>
						## Give meaningful column names<br>
						colnames(pb) <- c("Age","Sex","Speaker","Vowel","V1","F0.hz","F1.hz","F2.hz","F3.hz")<br>
						<br>
						## Fix up the age data<br>
						levels(pb$Age) <- c("Child","Adult","Adult")<br>
						pb$Age <- relevel(pb$Age, "Adult")
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Next, melt the data.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						pb.m <- melt(pb, id = 1:5)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Now, examine the balance of the data.
				</p>
				<blockquote>

						cast(pb.m, Vowel ~ Age+Sex)

					<rcode>

				<p>
					So, the data isn't necesarilly balanced in terms of numbers of speakers in each category, but every speaker produced the same number
					of each vowel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, let's calculate the mean formant values for each vowel in each category of speaker.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						pb.means1 <- cast(pb.m, Vowel + Sex + Age + variable ~ ., fun = mean)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<center>
					<a href = "plots/reshape/sex_age_formant.R"><img src = "plots/reshape/sex_age_formant.png" width = 100%></a>
				</center>
				<p>
					The patterns which seem most clear to me are
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The logarithmic distribution of formant values</li>
					<li>The order of low to high values go <br>
						Adult Male < Adult Female < Child Male < Child Female</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					To calculate speaker category means:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(pb.m, Vowel + Sex + Age ~ variable, fun = mean)
					</rcode>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					To calculate speaker means:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<rcode>
						cast(pb.m, Speaker + Vowel + Sex + Age ~ variable, fun = mean)
					</rcode>
